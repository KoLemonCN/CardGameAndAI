Version 0.16
To-Do list:
1:	Develop the GameRecorder to replace the GameHisotry to perform more sophisticated functions.

Version 0.17
To-Do list:
1:	Design a GameAnalyser to help Evaluator.
2:	Design an Evaluator to evaluate seed.
3:	Design an Evaluation to hold the report of a seed from a evaluator.
4:	Design a Decider to choose an action for the GameAI from all evaluations.

Version 0.18
To-Do list:
1:	Implement the Evaluation: a summary of a seed.

Version 0.18b
To-Do list:
1:	Modify the Evaluation: print manner for debug purpose; bug fixed.
2:	Modify the SpriteManager: print manner for debug purpose.

Version 0.19
To-Do list:
1:	Design the Decider: a simple action selection function.

Version 0.20
To-Do list:
1:	Implement a simple cards choose function for Decider.

Version 0.20b
To-Do list:
1:	Test the simple cards selection function for Decider.

Version 0.21
To-Do list:
1:	Add flexibility to the function:
	A:	The Decider would "probably" tend to break a combination in order to win.
	
Version 0.22
To-Do list:
1:	Revise the design. Add the Actions as the essential of the decision making.
	A:	Actions is a sequence of cards selection actions.
	B:	Additionally, the actions shall take the recorder
		 and probability calculator and ect. to validate
		 it's sequence and give a score as a result.
		 
Version 0.23
To-Do list:
1:	Program coding transformation.

Version 0.24
To-Do list:
1:	Program coding transformation test and revise.

Version 0.25
To-Do list:
1:	Revise the design of the Evaluation.
